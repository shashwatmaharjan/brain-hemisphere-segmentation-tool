# Brain Hemisphere Segmentation Tool

## Project Description
This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to segment the left and right hemispheres of the brain using a straight line, enabling accurate calculation of stroke areas. Additionally, the project includes a freehand line tool to demarcate any cell slices that may have merged as artifacts, ensuring proper segmentation.

## Features
- **Straight Line Segmentation:** Easily divide the brain into left and right hemispheres for precise stroke area calculation.
- **Freehand Line Tool:** Manually correct artifacts by drawing freehand lines to separate merged cell slices.
